This project analyzes house rent data to identify trends and patterns. 
It leverages Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn to clean, process, and visualize the data extracted from the 'houses_rent.xlsx' file.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Transform the raw data into a usable format by cleaning, renaming columns, changing data types, and handling missing values.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand distributions and relationships between variables.
* **Data Filtering and Aggregation:** Apply various filters and aggregation techniques using Pandas to isolate specific subsets of data for analysis, such as properties within certain price ranges or with specific characteristics.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilize Seaborn to create informative visualizations, such as bar plots and histograms, to depict trends and patterns like average rent prices by city, property type, and other features.

## Key Features

* Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis.
* Thorough EDA to understand the characteristics of rental properties.
* Data filtering and aggregation to focus on specific segments of the market.
* Clear and concise data visualizations using Seaborn to illustrate key findings.
* Well-commented code for easy understanding and reproducibility.
